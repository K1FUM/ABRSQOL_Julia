## This repository is for replication of Ahlfeldt et al. (2024) in Julia.

Ahlfeldt upload the replication package [here](https://github.com/Ahlfeldt/ABRSQOL-toolkit) containing Matlab, Python, R and Stata code. I just apply Julia code and replicate the results.

In the repository, the .ipynb file is my code for replication, .csv file is the dataset for test and .pdf file is their working paper.

If you have any questions, plz contact me.
