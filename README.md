## This repository is for replication of Ahlfeldt et al. (2024) in Julia.

Ahlfeldt upload the replication package here(https://github.com/Ahlfeldt/ABRSQOL-toolkit) containing Matlab, Python, R and Stata code. I just apply Julia code and replicate the results.

In the repository, the .ipynb file is my code for replication and .csv file is the dataset for test.

If you have any questions, plz contact me.
